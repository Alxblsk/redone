## Why Redone

This website is an answer to my procrastination multiplied with a willingness to write. I created personal blogs for years but always removed them after some time. I hope this time it won't happen but it seems like `Redone` is my motto for life.

## Under the hood

Gatsby Cloud and Contentful inside. every change is seamlessly deployed in production via Netlify. Works just fine. JAM in action.

## Plan

Currently, a blog is the only part of the website. However, with the flexibility of Gatsby to create customized pages, it should not be impossible to add new sections, not related to the blog itself.

While MVP is already done and currently running, there are still some ideas on how to expand functionality.

- [x] Create a minimal blog
- [x] Write a first general-purpose post
- [x] White a first technical post
- [ ] Write 10 posts
- [ ] Write a series of posts
- [ ] Publish one-page javascript applications made by me
